# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Java

- Utilizes a while loop to run the game until the user decides to exit.
- Employs if() and elseif() statements to compare user input with the computer's choice and determine the winner.

2. Enter your choice (r for Rock, p for Paper, s for Scissors) when prompted.
3. The computer will randomly select its option.
